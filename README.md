Just walked out of The Electric State, and I'm honestly not sure what to think right now. My brain feels like that one scene where everything's swirling and you can't tell up from down. The movie’s drenched in neon and shadows, like someone threw a paint can into a wind tunnel and called it art. In a good way. Sort of. I had popcorn stuck in my teeth the entire time, which somehow fit the whole chaotic vibe. 

There’s this girl, right? And robots. And this road trip. Except it’s not your typical fluffy road trip. More like a journey through someone's fever dream after reading too much cyberpunk. Halfway through, I started feeling the tiredness creep in, and not just because the popcorn wasn't working any magical energy miracles. It's just... dense. Like raw honey, sticking to every thought.

> The robots. They felt like they had more soul than some of the humans in the film, awkward mechanical spirits trying to find their place. Maybe they're what happens when you leave old toasters and broken laptops alone together for too long. Do they dream about electric sheep? Wait, I think that's a different movie.

There’s this one scene that made me laugh out loud — probably more than the director intended. A drone, wearing a hat. Like, seriously? A drone could start a fashion line with that move. Download the movie just to see that part. Then it tugged at my heart, and I wasn't ready for that. Sneaky, sentimental little bot.

function displayMemoryLoss() {
  let memories = null;
  if (memories === null) {
    console.log(All systems go!);
  }
}

Anyway, could anyone explain the ending to me? My eyes were on the screen, but my mind was back at the start. Or gone somewhere else entirely. It's like when you plant something, tend to it, and then a storm blows in and you're left wondering where the plant went. Maybe I’ll watch the movie again, - download it this time - and try to piece it all together, but right now all I want is a cold drink and a nap. Or maybe just that nap. Naps are the great equalizer, unlike this movie that left me sprawled across the spectrum of human emotion.
